Coming to IITP has been a wondeful experience till now. The 3 day orientation, as expected was very boring tho there were some points which were a bit interesting. After the orientation, the next thing was to explore the campus. Exploring the campus was like hitting a cardio session at the gym. The campus is very huge and has got many thrilling facilities (the hostel though has got some concerning issues). Then comes the most awaited event, NEBULA - The Freshers Party. Nebula was teh very first event we attended at IITP and it was a very amazing experience.
